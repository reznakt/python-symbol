    `Symbol` is a class whose constructor returns a `Symbol` value or just
    a `Symbol` â€” that's guaranteed to be unique. Symbols are often used to add
    unique property keys to an object that won't collide with keys any other
    code might add to the object.

    Every `Symbol()` call is guaranteed to return a unique `Symbol`.
    Every `Symbol.for("key")` call will always return the same `Symbol` for a
    given value of `"key"`. When ;Symbol.for("key")` is called, if a `Symbol`
    with the given key can be found in the global `Symbol` registry, that
    `Symbol` is returned. Otherwise, a new Symbol is created, added to the
    global `Symbol` registry under the given key, and returned.

        In contrast to `Symbol()`, the `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol
